Congratulations, you've got a job at Python Pizza! Your first job is to build an automatic pizza order program.
Based on a user's order, work out their final bill.
Small pizza (S): $15
Medium pizza (M): $20
Large pizza (L): $25
Add pepperoni for small pizza (Y or N): +$2
Add pepperoni for medium or large pizza (Y or N): +$3
Add extra cheese for any size pizza (Y or N): +$1
